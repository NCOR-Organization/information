6. PROV-O
   The Provenance ontology (PROV-O) is a W3C standard based upon the PROV data model that enables users to encode information about provenance - the history of ownership,
   permissions, and responsibilities with regards to all manner of entities. As a widely-used standard, PROV-O is important in the modeling of this kind of information to many
   institutions, and it would be a virtue of an ontology of information to be able to express information about provenance in a way that can be mapped into PROV-O. At the very
   least, an information ontology should be able to answer questions that users might have about the provenance of information entities such as documents, directives, and
   plans.
