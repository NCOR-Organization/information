The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an OBO foundry ontology designed to provide a shared terminology for scientific investigations in the biomedica domain. OBI includes more than 2500 terms, imports and adapts many terms from already existing OBO Foundry ontologies, and mutuates part of its information model from IAO. Nevertheless, OBI also substantially extends from IAO and introduces new classes of information entities, thus warranting a separate discussion of its information model.
