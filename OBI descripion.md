The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an OBO foundry ontology designed to provide a basic shared terminology for scientific investigations in the biomedica domain. OBI imports and adapts many terms from already existing OBO Foundry ontologies, and mutuates part of its information model from IAO. Nevertheless, OBI also extends and further develops IAO, thus warranting a separate discussion.
